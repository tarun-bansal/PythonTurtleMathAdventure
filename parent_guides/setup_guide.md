# Parent Guide: Setup and Getting Started

Each session is designed in 20-minute chunks with built-in break points (marked with ⏱️). Total session time is 45-60 minutes.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **Computer**: Windows, macOS, or Linux computer
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 500MB free space
- **Python Version**: 3.6 or newer

### Recommended Setup
- **Python 3.8+**: Latest stable version
- **Thonny IDE**: Beginner-friendly editor (highly recommended)
- **Mouse**: Helpful for turtle graphics interaction
- **Monitor**: Larger screen helps see code and graphics side-by-side

## 📦 Installation Guide

### Option 1: Complete Package (Recommended)
**Thonny** includes Python and is perfect for beginners:

1. **Download Thonny** from [thonny.org](https://thonny.org)
2. **Install** using the default settings
3. **Launch Thonny** - Python is ready to use!

**Why Thonny?**
- Built-in Python (no separate installation)
- Simple interface perfect for beginners
- Great debugging tools
- Excellent for turtle graphics

### Option 2: Python Only
If you prefer a different editor:

1. **Download Python** from [python.org](https://python.org)
2. **During installation**: CHECK "Add Python to PATH"
3. **Choose an editor**:
   - **VS Code**: Professional but more complex
   - **IDLE**: Comes with Python, simple but basic
   - **Sublime Text**: Lightweight and fast

## 🚀 First-Time Setup

### Testing Your Installation
Open Thonny (or your editor) and type:

```python
import turtle
print("Python is working! 🎉")
```

Run the program (green play button in Thonny). You should see "Python is working! 🎉" in the output area.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Python not found" error**
- Windows: Reinstall and check "Add to PATH"
- macOS/Linux: Open terminal, type `python3 --version`

**Turtle window doesn't appear**
- Some systems need additional graphics libraries
- Try installing `tkinter`: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` (Linux)
- Or use online Python editors as backup

**Program runs but closes immediately**
- Add `turtle.done()` at end of program
- Or add `input("Press Enter to exit...")`

## 📚 Course Structure

### 12 Sessions, 3 Phases
**Phase 1: Foundations** (Sessions 1-4)
- Basic commands, variables, input, loops
- Immediate visual results build confidence

**Phase 2: Building Skills** (Sessions 5-8)
- Conditionals, functions, lists, advanced math
- More complex programs and problem-solving

**Phase 3: Creative Projects** (Sessions 9-12)
- Animation, fractals, games, final project
- Synthesis and creative expression

### Session Format
Each session includes:
1. **Learning Objectives**: Clear goals
2. **Theory with Analogies**: Kid-friendly explanations
3. **Hands-on Exercises**: Step-by-step practice
4. **Math Connections**: Real math applications
5. **Challenges**: Optional extension problems
6. **Checklist**: Self-assessment

## ⏰ Time Management

### Recommended Schedule
- **Session Length**: 45-60 minutes
- **Frequency**: 1-2 sessions per week
- **Breaks**: Every 15-20 minutes
- **Practice Between Sessions**: Optional 15-30 minutes

### Pacing Guidelines
- **Fast Learner**: Can complete multiple sessions per week
- **Average Pace**: 1 session per week (12 weeks total)
- **Slower Pace**: Stretch sessions over 2 meetings
- **Flexible**: Mix and match based on interest

## 🎯 Learning Environment

### Physical Setup
- **Comfortable seating**: Good posture important
- **Adequate lighting**: Reduce eye strain
- **Minimal distractions**: Focus on learning
- **Notebook**: For planning and debugging notes

### Mindset Tips
- **Celebrate mistakes**: Debugging is detective work
- **Encourage curiosity**: "What happens if I change this?"
- **Focus on process**: Not just the end result
- **Growth mindset**: Skills develop with practice

## 🔧 Technical Support

### When Your Child Gets Stuck

**First: Encourage Problem-Solving**
- "What did you expect to happen?"
- "What actually happened?"
- "What's different?"
- "Can you explain the code to me?"

**Then: Debugging Strategies**
1. **Read error messages** together
2. **Check for typos** (case-sensitive!)
3. **Test small parts** of the code
4. **Add print statements** to see values
5. **Take a break** and come back fresh

### Common Programming Errors

| Error | Common Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `SyntaxError` | Missing `:` or `()` | Check punctuation |
| `IndentationError` | Mixed tabs/spaces | Use 4 spaces consistently |
| `NameError` | Misspelled variable | Check spelling |
| `TypeError` | Wrong data type | Check `int()` vs `str()` |
| `IndexError` | List index out of range | Check `len(list)` first |

## 📞 Additional Resources

### Online Backup Options
