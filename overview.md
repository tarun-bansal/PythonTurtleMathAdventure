7. **Lists: The Programmer's Collection**: Data structures, indexing, iteration
8. **Math Operations & Problem Solving**: Advanced operators, math module, puzzles

### Phase 3: Visual & Creative (Sessions 9-12)
**Goal**: Synthesize skills into creative projects

9. **Animation: Bringing Drawings to Life**: Game loops, timing, interactive graphics
10. **Fractals: Math in Nature**: Recursion, self-similarity, natural patterns
11. **Game Design: Math Challenges**: Complete games, scoring, user interaction
12. **Final Project: Math Art Gallery**: Independent project, debugging, presentation
